## SAP - Starling Alternativa3D Particles
### Description
SAP is a port of [Alternativa3D Particle System](https://github.com/AlternativaPlatform/Alternativa3D/tree/master/src/alternativa/engine3d/effects) to Starling Framework.
This particle system is really well optimized for rendering on mobile. All particle data goes to GPU through vertexconstants. There are no any vertexbuffer uploads each frame.
